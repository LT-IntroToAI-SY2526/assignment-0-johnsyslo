## Reading Comprehension Questions
All answers can be found in the README.md file

**1. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?**

Git is a version control system while Github is a easy to use interface that allows users to interact with Git without having to use a terminal.

**2. Explain what "committing and pushing" means in your own words. Why are these steps important?**

Commits are basically "checkpoints" that save your work and push it to your local repo, there people also working with you on the same network can interact with your code. You can even leave a helpful message. Pushing pushes all the commits to the remote repo, pushing it onto the internet such as on Github for everybody to see. These are important as they help keep code clean and descriptive with commit/push messages as well as leave you with versions in case a bug or flaw pops up.

**3. What is a repository and what does it contain?**

A repository contains the code you push. It also contains a README.md that can be used to give users information on how to use the code contained in your repo and how it works and more.
